Portability (find out how other Unicies do things)

Presently developed and tested on a Linux 2.6 box, with code that
has in the past been tested on OpenBSD and FreeBSD.  Intending to
test on FreeBSD and Solaris as I have access to instances of those.

Include syntax, use yywrap() chaining with a queue or stack of files

Guide to setting up ssh (security check), nagios, etc.

Potential checks:
 - percent CPU idle
 - page/swap/fork rates
 - number of open files
 - NTP (use regular Nagios check, probably)
 - mail queue check (delegate that too)
 - cron and other key processes
 - zombie procs

Avoid statting NFS in case stale.
