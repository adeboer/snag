.TH snag.conf 5 "Monitoring"
.UC 4

.SH NAME
snag.conf - configuration file for
.IR snag (8).

.SH DESCRIPTION

Directives in
.I @sysconfdir@/snag.conf
(if present) will be used to modify the operation of
.IR snag (8).

Whitespace, emty lines, and comments are allowed.

.TP
.B limit item_ID LOW_CRITICAL LOW_WARNING HIGH_WARNING HIGH_CRITICAL

A "limit" directive can set alerting thresholds for detected numeric
values.  See the -b output for identifiers and default values.  A line
from it can be copied into the configuration file and modified.  The
four numeric values are LOW_CRITICAL, LOW_WARNING, HIGH_WARNING, and
HIGH_CRITICAL.  A value between the middle pair is considered OK,
a value between the outer pair merits a WARNING, and a value outside
them generates a CRITICAL alert.

Example:

limit Disk_space 3 10 110 120

If the item_ID is a directory mountpoint it sets thresholds for
reporting on the corresponding filesystem, in percentages of space
still available blockwise and inodewise (no provision is made to
set different thresholds for blocks vs inodes on a filesystem).
This also overrides snag's intuition about which filesystems should
be reported and tag this one as being interesting.  By default snag
reports on filesystems mounted read-write on a physical device (a
device path starting with a / character). Linux "bind" mounts are
skipped.

.TP
.B nodf mount_point

Tells snag not to report on the filesystem mounted at mount_point.

.TP
.B process agetty 1 6

Tells snag that we expect to see no fewer than 1 and no more than 6
agetty processes running (as an example).

.TP
.B expect process1 [ process2 ... ]

Tells snag that we expect to see at least one of the named processes
running, and to alert if any are absent.

.TP
.B ignore process1 [ process2 ... ]

Lists processes that are to be ignored if present.  This may be used
for things like shells and editors that sysadmins might leave running.

.TP
.B variable = value

Sets a snag variable. Significant ones include 
"sysuidmax" which sets the UID value above which processes are ignored,
"transient_time" which is the maximum time that an unconfigured process
can run before causing an alert (to remind you to add new daemons to
snag.conf and the system default runlevel, otherwise after the next
reboot they aren't running and you scratch your head), and
"max_same_proc" which is the maximum number of instances of a process
not otherwise configured with a
.I process
directive that can be running before causing an alert.

.TP
.B command "description" "commandline"

This causes an external command (a Nagios check) to be run by snag and
its output to be included with snag's output.  The description and
commandline must both be given as quoted strings.

Example:

command "NTP jitter" "@pluginsdir@/check_ntp ..."

Note that the check should output just one line of Nagios data, and
certainly should not output more than 512 bytes.  Snag does not read the
pipe from the check's standard output until after that exits, since no
check should output so voluminously much that the pipe blocks waiting to
be read.

.SH FILES

.I @sysconfdir@/snag.conf

.SH SEE ALSO

.IR snag (8),
.IR check_snag (8)

.SH NOTE
Running
.B snag -b
causes it to output its internal configuration defaults in the same
format as the configuration file.  Note that any existing configuration
file is not read, and normal processing does not occur.
