Snag Installation
-----------------

Things that may need tweaking:

check_snag.c: NAGIOSRW is the Nagios external command pipe.
snagmsgs: CONF is the configuration file containing your passive checks,
 and LOG is the Nagios logfile.

After that,

./configure
make
(as root) make install


Configuration
-------------

These tweaks are to Nagios config files, possibly found in /etc/nagios
or /usr/local/etc/nagios or such.

in nagios.cfg
+++++++++++++

check_external_commands=1


in checkcomands.cfg
+++++++++++++++++++

define command{
  command_name  check_dummy
  command_line  /bin/true
  }

define command{
  command_name  check_self
  command_line  /usr/local/bin/check_snag $HOSTNAME$ /usr/local/bin/snag
  }

define command{
  command_name  check_snag
  command_line  /usr/local/bin/check_snag $HOSTNAME$ /usr/bin/ssh snag@$HOSTADDRESS$
  }

in services.cfg
+++++++++++++++

define service{
        use                     generic-service
        name                    generic-passive
        active_checks_enabled   0
        passive_checks_enabled  1
        check_command           check_dummy
        register                0
        }

Then to start things off for each remote host we run check_snag itself
as an active check something like so:

define service{
        use                     generic-service
        host_name               thatone
        check_command           check_snag
        service_description     Snag Remote Check
        }

and for localhost:

define service{
        use                     generic-service
        host_name               thisone
        check_command           check_self
        service_description     Snag Self Check
        }

Letting Nagios run with that should cause these checks to work, so that's
phase one done.  To get the actual check data from each line item, there
are a bunch of little items to configure, but that's what we have snagmsgs
for.  After these checks have run, your Nagios logfile should contain
error messages of the form "Message queue contained results for service
'whatever' on host 'thatone'.  The service could not be found!".  Snagmsgs
will parse those errors and your existing services.cfg and generate lines
that should be added to services.cfg.  Do so, SIGHUP Nagios, and you should
see all of the individual check items.

On Remote Boxes
+++++++++++++++

You need to install this package on remote boxes too, possibly along with
the Nagios Plugins if you want to run any of them on the remote boxes.

Create a "snag" user, with the snag executable as its shell, and set up an
unpassphrased SSH key (or use ssh-agent) such that the Nagios server can
SSH in as the snag user on the remote box.
